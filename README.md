# CoronaGotUs
An iOS sample project to show the advancements in Germany corona-wise per region.
The app uses an interactive map to display the regions according to EU/Bavarian corona signals. 
You can select different regions and get to know all the info about it.
You can also allow the app to access your location to know more about current location situation.
Allowing the app to send notifcations means you will receive notifications when you change signals.
The app depends on RKI apis and ASG servers and ios-runtime-sdk
